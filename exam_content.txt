English spelling is notoriously complicated and

combinations (graphemes) in the written language; correspondingly, many graphemes have more than one pronunciation. This is because English has absorbed words (20)	many other languages,
especially French, Latin and classical Greek, into its Germanic base, and mainly taken over spellings or transliterations of those words without (21)	them
to the original system.

Current regulations in the US do not require that people who privately own chimpanzees obtain a permit to keep them, ----.
as widespread habitat loss and poaching have caused their numbers to decline
whereas chimpanzees are not in urgent need of help

In 1973, Bill Gates entered Harvard University to study computer science after discovering his knack for electrical engineering and code while
creating software for his high school at the age of
13. Gates would never walk out of Harvard with a degree‒or any college with a degree for that matter. Still, some argue the business expertise, technical skills and long-term visions he possessed would
be worth much more than a diploma. Because
when Gates dropped out in 1975, it was with good reason: He wanted to start Microsoft. His career has been recognized for small flare-ups and constant comparisons with Apple founder Steve Jobs, ongoing philanthropy and technological innovation. Gates has been knighted by the Queen of England, became a billionaire when he was merely 31 years old and developed the Microsoft Disk Operating System for IBM in 1980. While he is no longer at
the head of Microsoft, Bill Gates continues to leave his mark on history. In 2008, he left Microsoft to dedicate himself full-time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he leads with his wife, Melinda Gates. Through their organization, the couple has donated more than $28 billion to various causes.
Which of the following is true about Bill Gates?
He does not have a diploma from an institution of higher education.
He confronted Steve Jobs on several occasions.
He had not been formally introduced to the
Queen of England before he was knighted.
He was unwilling to leave Microsoft, but he did
so anyway.
He sees formal education as an obstacle to success.
As can be inferred from the passage ----.
Microsoft is in urgent need of an innovative
leader like Bill Gates
graduating from a college is necessary for success in the absence of certain traits
Melinda Gates can be considered as the actual
mastermind behind Microsoft
it turned out that dropping out of college was
the right thing to do for Bill Gates
Harvard University has a habit of attracting
talents, most of whom end up dropping out
One point in the passage made about Bill Gates is that ----.
he regrets having missed the chance to graduate from Harvard, though he ultimately became a billionaire
his achievements did not go unnoticed by the royal family
he has experienced some ups and downs throughout his career
he was challenged by few competitors in technological innovation
the idea of founding a company of his own developed right before he enrolled in college
It is understood from the passage that ----.
Bill Gates has been completely involved with
charity work since he left Microsoft
IBM was a highly influential company in the 1980s
Melinda Gates took over the operations of the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation after Bill Gates stepped down
a great deal of money has been spent on the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation since its inception
the early 70s was an era that presented huge opportunities to become rich and famous
Jessie:
This video I’ve watched claims that people are fairly good at detecting a person’s gender based on handwriting samples alone.
Walter:
I’m not surprised at all, because girls almost always have neater handwriting, but I don’t know why.
Jessie:
‑‑‑‑
Walter:
It is probably a little bit of both.
You don’t know why because you never do any reading on issues like this.
It is a fact that boys are sloppier with their writing, and this can be observed even at the very early stages.
Just because most girls have better handwriting than boys does not mean they also write better.
That’s the other issue explained in the video. The question of whether the reason for this has to do with nature or nurture.
Yes, but I don’t think we can just assume the
girls have better handwriting than boys.
Junior:
Whenever I do online shopping, I can’t help but fear that my personal information may be stolen.
Skyler:
‑‑‑‑
Junior:
So does that mean I have nothing to worry about?
Skyler:
Not exactly. You still have to make sure you buy your stuff from trusted websites.
I used to feel the same, but it eventually goes
away.
Online shopping is all nice and easy, but there
are some inherent problems related with it.
Well, it actually may. So, it’s always better be
safe than sorry.
There is always the possibility of that happening. But the best way to avoid it is to stop shopping online.
That kind of thing does not happen as frequently as you think it does, but that does not mean you should do nothing about it.
The Battle of Gettysburg differs from the Battle of Waterloo in that it is regarded by posterity as a moral as well as a military victory.
The main difference between the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Waterloo was the underlying causes leading up to both, not only the moral but also the military ones.
The Battle of Gettysburg was considered both an ethical and a crushing victory by future generations, whereas the Battle of Waterloo was seen as a disgrace.
Regarded by the posterity as a moral victory rather than being a military triumph, the Battle of Waterloo was different from the Battle of Gettysburg.
What separates the Battle of Gettysburg from the Battle of Waterloo is that the former is deemed by posterity not only as a righteous victory but also as a military triumph.
The Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Waterloo were not different from each other as both were fought on moral and military grounds.
In the final decades of the nineteenth century, Russia underwent the social and economic transformations that, centuries earlier, had given rise to urban culture in much of Western Europe.
The social and economic transformations that centuries ago made urban culture possible in most of Western Europe were experienced by Russia in the late nineteenth century.
The late nineteenth century marks the social and economic transformations that Russia went through just like the Western European countries did a long time ago.
Russia went through social and economic transformations in the late nineteenth century, which created a sense of urban culture in much of the country that shares similar characteristics to Western Europe.
Urban culture of the nineteenth century in most Western European countries was inspired by the social and economic transformations that occurred in Russia centuries earlier.
Most European countries experienced in the last few decades of the nineteenth century what Russia had gone through centuries earlier in terms of social and economic issues.
Perhaps no feature of South Korea’s development stands out more than its transition in fifty years from a nation where a majority of the adult population was illiterate to one of the world’s most schooled societies.
The most striking aspect about the progress of South Korea is probably its evolution in half a century from a country with an overwhelmingly illiterate adult population to one with one of the most educated societies in the world.
South Korea stands out as a country that characteristically transformed itself into one of the world’s most educated societies by educating the majority of its adult population that could not even read and write fifty years ago.
South Korea’s efforts through the last fifty years towards transforming its predominantly illiterate adult population are probably paying off as the country is becoming one of the world’s most schooled societies today.
One striking feature of South Korea, which managed to transform the majority of its illiterate adult population into a well-educated one in fifty years, is probably its fifty-year transformation into a society made up of highly educated individuals.
One of the world’s most schooled societies, South Korea has been going through an educational transition for the last fifty years as it strives to educate the illiterate population that makes up the majority in the country.

Located in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is one of the most ancient civilizations in the world, a place where traditional culture, firmly fixed in the past, is continually challenged by the customs of the modern world. One of the treasures of this country is its manuscript culture, inseparably tied to the Christian tradition	This rich cultural heritage is
particularly vulnerable to damage, loss and destruction, and requires a variety of approaches for its preservation.
Sometimes a simple, fundamental change to the method of storage, such as raising
volumes from the floor, can effectively improve
manuscript security.
Experience in the preservation of written materials from such areas has shown that attempts to transfer unrealistic
recommendations and high standards invariably fail.
As for Ethiopia, dissimilarities result mainly from different methods of manufacturing and indirectly from the type of mainly goat leather used to produce it.
There are thousands of churches in Ethiopia, and stored in nearly every one are parchment manuscripts which contain ancient and sometimes unknown religious texts.
The cross symbolizes the strength and reliance of the monarchy on the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the dominant religion for the last sixteen hundred years.
Brainstorming took the business world by storm in 1948, when advertising agent Alex Osborn published his book, “Your Creative Power.” He advised workers to gather in a group and swap ideas, but never voice criticism or opposition.
---- However, several studies have shown that brainstorming results in fewer and less effective ideas than other tactics, such as working alone before pooling ideas, or engaging in debate.
In theory, this would allow everyone to speak
freely and without fear of being judged.
Some web-based brainstorming techniques allowed contributors to post their comments anonymously through the use of avatars.
Exchanging ideas in a group may reduce the number of domains that a group explores for additional ideas.
Directed brainstorming is also a variation of electronic brainstorming which can be done manually or with computers.
Therefore, participants engaged in a discussion
that involved a great deal of criticism.
Skeletal evidence from every inhabited continent suggests that our brains have become smaller in the past 10,000 to 20,000 years. ---- Brain size is scaled to body size because a larger body requires a larger nervous system
to service it. As bodies became smaller, so did brains. A smaller body also suggests a smaller pelvic size in females, so selection would have favoured the delivery of smaller-headed babies.
For more than 7 million years the hominid brain has grown increasingly bigger, almost tripling in size.
Some believe the erosion of our grey matter means that modern humans are indeed getting dumber.
Domesticated animals do not require the extra brainpower that could help them evade predators or hunt for food.
Some of this shrinkage is very likely related to the decline in humans’ average body size during the past 10,000 years.
New research has attempted to answer this question by examining size changes in specific regions of the brain.
(I) Africa possesses both written and unwritten traditions. (II) The former are relatively well known‒at any rate the recent writings in European languages. (III) The unwritten forms, however, are far less widely known and appreciated. (IV) Such forms do not fit neatly into the familiar categories of literate cultures. (V) There is no mystery about the first and most basic characteristic of oral literature.

(I) The belief that all genuine education comes about through experience does not mean that all experiences are genuinely or equally educative
(II) In other words, experience and education cannot be directly equated to each other. (III) This is mainly because some experiences are mis-educative.
(IV) These include the ones that have the effect of arresting or distorting the growth of further experience. (V) No one would question that a child in a slum tenement has a different kind of
experience from that of a child in a cultured home.

(I) A benefit-cost analysis is often required in determining whether a project should be approved and is useful for comparing similar projects.
It determines the stream of quantifiable economic benefits and costs that are associated with a project or policy. (III) A surprisingly large number of people can be involved with projects in one way or another. (IV) If the benefits exceed the costs, the project is worth doing. (V) If the benefits fall short of the costs, the project is not.

(I) The standard gene duplication model explains many of the thousands of known gene families, but this model has some limitations. (II) Genes, like people, have families‒lineages that stretch back through time, all the way to a founding member.
That ancestor multiplied and spread, morphing a bit with each new iteration. (IV) For most of the last 40 years, scientists thought that this was the primary way new genes were born‒they simply arose from copies of existing genes. (V) The old version went on doing its job, and the new copy became free to evolve novel functions.
I	B) II	C) III	D) IV	E) V
(I) William Shakespeare is one of the most impressive literary minds in history‒a master of theatre and poetry with no equal. (II) He wrote 37 plays and five poetry collections, writing a total of 17,677 unique words. (III) Around 10 percent of the words he used were entirely of his own invention.
Considering how fast our language changes, and how long ago Shakespeare’s works were written, it is not surprising that his plays and sonnets can seem unintelligible. (V) Out of all the words
you use today, at least one of them was probably invented by William Shakespeare, assuming, of course, you speak English.

painstakingly	: titiz bir şekilde, kılı kırk yararak
cruelly	: acımasız bir şekilde
predominantly	: genellikle, çoğunlukla, yoğunluklu olarak
sincerely	: samimi bir şekilde
şeklinde dizilmiştir. Seçenekler arasında anlam olarak cümleyi en uygun şekilde tamamlayan kelime D seçeneğindeki “genellikle, çoğunlukla, yoğunluklu olarak” anlamı veren “predominantly” zarfıdır. Buna göre, cümleyi anlamca en uygun şekilde tamamlayan “predominantly” zarfının verildiği D seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
B	Soru kökünde genel olarak “İnsanoğlunun ilk ve en gizemli sanatsal başarılarının bazıları, doğal olgularının “doğaüstü” şeklinde yanlış yorumlanmasından …‑mış olabilir.” şeklinde tamamlanması gereken bir ifade mevcuttur. Seçeneklerdeki kelimeler fiildir ve bu kelimeler,
implied (imply)	: ima etmek
inspire(d)	: ilham almak, ilham vermek
coin(ed)	: (bir kelime, kavram, ifade) türetmek, bulmak
contradict(ed)	: çelişmek
allocate(d)	: tahsis etmek
şeklinde dizilmiştir. Seçenekler arasında anlam olarak cümleyi en uygun şekilde tamamlayan kelime B seçeneğindeki “ilham almak, ilham vermek” anlamı veren “inspire” kelimesidir. Buna göre, cümleyi anlamca en uygun şekilde tamamlayan “inspire” fiilinin verildiği B seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
C	Soru kökünde “Birçok uzman desalinasyonun (tuzdan arındırma) Kaliforniya’nın hassas su kaynağını korumak ve geliştirmek için gelecekteki stratejisinin kaçınılmaz bir ‑‑‑‑ olduğunu söylemektedir.” şeklinde tamamlanması gereken bir ifade mevcuttur. Seçeneklerdeki kelimeler isimdir ve bu kelimeler,
devastation	: yıkım, tahribat
disposal	: ortadan kaldırma, elden çıkarma
component	: öğe, unsur, bileşen
confusion	: kafa karışıklığı
judgement	: yargı, muhakeme

/ were Ving (past continuous tense)” dizilimler genellikle “V2 (simple past tense)” ya da yine “was / were Ving (past continuous tense)” dizilimlerle beraber kullanılır. Bu seçeneğin ilk tarafındaki “had to be recruited” dizilimi de bir “V2” çekimlemedir. Bu durumda E seçeneğinin doğru olabilmesi için son gereken şey “was / were Ving (past continuous tense)” dizilimlerin görevi gereği iki boşlukta anlatılan olayların birbirini bölen olaylar olmasıdır. Ama soru kökü anlam bakımından analiz edildiğinde ilk boşlukta
anlatılan olayın ikinci boşluktaki olayı bölen / kesen / durduran bir olay olmadığı görülür. Bu yüzden E
seçeneği her ne kadar çeviri olarak kulağa hoş geliyormuş gibi dursa da doğru yanıt olamaz. Ayrıca dikkat etmek gerekir ki “was / were Ving (past continuous tense)” geçmişte periyot / alışkanlık anlatmak için kullanılmaz. Bunun için “V2”, “used to V0” veya “would V0” kullanılır. Sonuç olarak geriye A seçeneği
kalır. Her iki tarafı da “V2 (simple past tense)” çekimlemelerden oluşan bu seçenek soru kökünü hem
dilbigisi olarak hem de anlam olarak doğru bir şekilde tamamlayabilmektedir. Soru kökündeki cümleye A
seçeneği eklendiği zaman genel olarak “Osmanlı ordularının elit birlikleri olan yeniçeriler tabi halkların çocuklarından toplanırdı ve Müslüman olarak yetiştirilirdi ve küçük çocukluk döneminden itibaren asker olmak üzere eğitilirdi.” şeklinde anlamlı bir bütün oluşur. Bu bağlamda soru kökünde verilen ifadelerin geçmişteki bir olayı anlattığına, etken – edilgen (aktif – pasif) ve zamanların özelliklerine dikkat edilerek çözülebilecek olan bu soruda doğru yanıt A seçeneğidir.
E	Bu soruda “adverbial clause” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökünde verilen boşluk iki cümleyi birbirine bağlamaktadır. Bundan dolayı öncelik bağlaç olan seçeneklere verilmelidir. Bu bağlamda ilk olarak “olmasa, olmasaydı” anlamına gelen bir ifade olan “but for” edatının bulunduğu B seçeneği elenir. Kalan seçeneklerin tamamı bağlaçtır ve ilk yapılması gereken şey bu bağlaçlar arasında aynı anlamı veren ve dolayısıyla birbirini zayıflatabilen bağlaçlar varsa bunları elemektir. Seçenekler bu bağlamda incelendiğinde A seçeneğindeki “because”, D seçeneğindeki “now that” ve C seçeneğindeki “as” bağlaçlarının neden‑sonuç anlatabilen bağlaçlar olduğu görülür. Dolayısıyla A ve D seçenekleri ve C seçeneğindeki “as” bağlacının neden-sonuç anlatma görevi birbirini eler. Geriye neden-sonuç ilişkisi anlatmak dışında “‑ken”, “‑dığı gibi” ve “‑dıkça/ dikçe” gibi görevleri olan “as” bağlacı ve “‑e rağmen, ‑se de / sa da, ‑sa bile, ama” anlamlarını vererek zıtlık anlatabilen “though” bağlacı özelinde soru kökü anlam analizine tabi tutmak kalır. Boşluğun sol
tarafında genel olarak “Güçlenmekte olan bir El Nino’nun kuraklığı sona erdirecek yağışlı bir kışı bölgeye getirdiğinden” bahseden olumlu bir anlatım vardır. Boşluğun sağında ise “durumun tamamıyla iyileşmesinin yıllar alacağından” bahseden olumsuz bir anlatım yapılmaktadır. Bu durumda boşluğun iki tarafındaki cümleler arasında bir zıtlık ilişkisi olduğu düşünülebilir ve bu bağlamda zıtlık bildiren “though” bağlacının olduğu E seçeneği doğru cevap olur. E seçeneğindeki bağlaç cümleye eklendiğinde genel olarak “Güçlenmekte olduğu görülen bir El Nino, kuraklığı sona erdirecek yağışlı bir kışı sonunda bölgeye getirecek ama durumun tamamıyla iyileşmesi yıllar alacak.” şeklinde bir çeviri elde edilir.
D	Bu soruda “edat” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökünde “Ülkedeki siyasi anlaşmazlıklar ve kaynak eksikliği‑… bir kamu sağlığı meselesi olan intihar konusu büyük oranda görmezden gelinmektedir.” şeklinde tamamlanması gereken bir ifade bulunmaktadır. Seçeneklerde verilen ifadelerin tamamı edattır ve bu ifadeler
except for	: -ın haricinde, -ın dışında (apart from, but, saving)
despite	: -e rağmen (in spite of)
pertaining to : ile ilgili (about, as to, with respect to, with regard to, regarding)
because of : ‑den dolayı, ‑ın yüzünden (due to, owing to, thanks to, in view of, on account of)
instead of	: -ın yerine (benzer bir ifade olarak “rather than”)
şeklinde dizilmiştir. Seçenekler arasında anlam olarak cümleyi en uygun şekilde tamamlayan ifade D seçeneğindeki “‑den dolayı, ‑ın yüzünden” anlamlarına gelen “because of” edatıdır. Buna göre cümleyi anlamca en uygun şekilde tamamlayan “because of” edatının verildiği D seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
B	Bu soruda “gerund ‑ infinitive” ve “etken – edilgen (aktif – pasif)” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Boşluğun bir gerund yapıyla mı yoksa infinitive yapıyla mı tamamlanacağını bulmak için boşluğun sol tarafına doğru açılmak gerekir. Soru kökünde boşluğun solunda bulunan “is said” edilgen – pasif yapısı doğru yanıta ulaşmak için gerekli olan ipucudur çünkü İngilizcede üç tane edilgen – pasif dizilim dışında (be seen, be caught, be found*) kalan edilgen dizilimler “infinitive” yapı ile devam eder (edilgen – pasif + to V0 /
to have V3). Bu bağlamda öncelik bir “perfect infinitive” olan B seçeneğindeki “to have been caused”
ifadesine, C seçeneğindeki “to be caused” ifadesine ve bir “continuous infinitive” olan D seçeneğindeki
“to be causing” ifadesine verilir. “Perfect infinitive” yapılar (etken – aktif halleri: to have V3; edilgen – pasif halleri: to have been V3) cümlenin yüklemi ile kıyaslandığında daha geçmişe gönderme yapmak için kullanılırken, standart “infinitive” yapılar “geleceğe” gönderme yapar. “Continuous infinitive” dizilimler
ise konuşma anına gönderme yapar. Seçeneklerde bahsedilen “cause” eylemi “M.Ö. 430 yılında Atina’da olan büyük vebanın sebenini anlatan” eylem olup cümlenin yüklemi olan “is said” çekimlemesine kıyasla daha geçmişteki bir olaya gönderme yaptığı için B seçeneğindeki “to have V3” yapısı boşluğu doğru
tamamlayan yapı olacaktır. Dolayısıyla bu yapıyı bulunduran B seçeneği doğru yanıttır. Ayrıca boşluğun
sağında bulunan “by” edatının boşluğa gelecek olan yapının “edilgen – pasif” olması gerektiğine işaret ettiği düşünüldüğünde de etken – aktif bir çekimleme olan D seçeneğindeki “to be causing” elenebilir. Soru kökünde genel olarak “Atina’da M.Ö.430 yazında patlak veren Büyük Atina Vebasına (kime sorduğunuza bağlı olarak) tifo, kızamık, suçiçeği ya da Ebola tarafından neden olunduğu söylenir” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır.
* be found edilgen – pasif yapısı “tespit etmek” anlamında kullanıldığında devamına to V0 alır.
C	Bu soruda “adverbial clause” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökündeki boşluk iki cümleyi birbirine bağlamaktadır. Bu bağlamda boşluğa gelmesi gereken ifade bir “bağlaç” olmalıdır. Seçeneklerin tamamının bağlaç olabilecek ifadelerden oluştuğu görülmektedir. A seçeneğindeki “as though” bağlacı “‑mış gibi, sanki” anlamlarına gelir ve “as if” ile aynı görevdedir. Bu bağlaç verdiği anlam gereği “unreal” anlatımlar yapar ve genellikle öncesinde “treat, act, behave, speak, talk, seem, appear, look, feel, take” gibi fiiller görülür. Bu bağlacın soru kökünün başında kullanılması daha da spesifik bir kullanım olur ve yan cümlede “enough” veya bu kelimeyle eş anlamlı kelimeleri bulundurmayı gerektirebilir. Soru kökündeki cümle A seçeneğindeki “as though” bağlacının anlatılan bu kullanım özelliklerine uygun bir görüntüye sahip değildir.
B seçeneğindeki “so that” bağlacı “‑sın diye, ‑mesi / ması amacıyla, ‑mek / mak için” anlamlarına gelir. Bu bağlaç sol yanına bir virgül alırsa “bu yüzden, bundan dolayı, dolayısıyla” anlamlarını verir. C seçeneğindeki “when” zaman bağlacı da “‑dığında, ‑dığı zaman, ‑ken” çevirileriyle iki cümleyi birbirine bağlayabilir. D seçeneğindeki “only after” ifadesi aslında “‑den sonra” anlamına gelen “after” zaman bağlacının başına “ancak, sadece, yalnızca” anlamına gelen “only” kelimesinin getirilmesiyle oluşmuştur. Bu bağlamda “only after” bağlacı “ancak …‑den sonra” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Bu noktada
bilinmesi gereken en önemli bilgi şudur: “only after, only when, only if” bağlaçları, yan ve ana cümlelerini devamına aldığında ana cümlelerini devrik yaparlar. Soru kökündeki boşluğun ana cümlesi devrik olmadığı için D seçeneği doğru yanıt olamaz. E seçeneğindeki “just as” bağlacı “nasıl ki, ‑dığı gibi” anlamlarını verir. “Just as” bağlacı ile ilgili bilinmesi gereken önemli bir nokta bulunmaktadır. Bu bağlacın bağladığı iki cümle arasında “benzer kelime ve yapı tekrarları” olmalıdır ve bu bağlaç yardımıyla anlam olarak paralel olan iki cümleyle benzetme yapılır. Soru kökündeki cümleler anlam bakımından dikkatli analiz edilirse
bu tarz bir anlatım olmadığı dikkat çekecektir. Bu bilgiler ışığında öncelik B ve C seçeneklerine verilerek anlam analizine başlanabilir. Soru kökündeki boşluğun yan cümlesinde genel olarak “sizden daha az bilen birine (bir konuyu) anlatmak zorunda kalırsınız” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılırken ana cümlede “materyali nihayetinde siz kendiniz de öğrenmiş oluyorsunuz” çevirisi bulunmaktadır. Bu anlatımlar B ve C seçenekleri anlam bakımından analiz edildiğinde doğru yanıtın C seçeneğindeki “when” bağlacı olduğu görülür. Bu bağlaç ile tamamlandığında soru kökünde “Sizden daha az bilen birine (bir konuyu) anlatmak zorunda kaldığınız zaman materyali siz kendiniz de öğrenmiş oluyorsunuz” şeklinde bir anlam bütünlüğü oluşmuş olur. Sonuç olarak bu soruda “when” bağlacının bulunduğu C seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
B	Bu soruda “adverbial clause” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökünde boşluğun iki cümleyi bağlamakta olduğu görülür. Bu bağlamda boşluğa gelmesi gereken ifade öncelikli olarak bir “bağlaç” olmalıdır. Bu bağlamda her ne kadar cümle zarflarının nadiren de olsa bağlaç konumunda kullanılabilse de C seçeneğindeki “however” cümle zarfı öncelik verilecek seçenek olma durumunu kaybeder. İlk olarak kalan seçeneklerdeki bağlaçlar değerlendirilmelidir. A seçeneğindeki “although” bir zıtlık bağlacıdır
ve “‑e rağmen, ‑se de / sa da, ‑sa bile” anlamlarına gelebilir. B seçeneğindeki “given that” bağlacı “considering that” bağlacı eş anlamlıdır ve “‑mesi / ması düşünüldüğünde, göz önüne alındığında” gibi çeviriler verir. D seçeneğindeki “only then” bağlacı “ancak …‑ın ardından, yalnızca …‑den sonra” gibi anlamlar verebilir. E seçeneğinde “‑mezse / mazsa, ‑medikçe / madıkça” anlamlarını veren “unless” bağlacı bulunmaktadır ve bu bağlaç her zaman olmamakla birlikte genellikle ana cümlesinde olumsuz
bir yargı alarak çoğunlukla “if Clause Type 1” dizilimler oluşturur. Öncelik sıralamasında geride kalan C seçeneği dışında bütün seçenekleri anlam bakımından soru köküyle analiz etmek doğru olacaktır.
Soru kökünde boşluğun sol tarafında “Günümüzde güneş enerjisinin uygulanabilirliği konusunda şüpheci olmanın kolay olduğundan” bahsedilmektedir. Boşluğun sağ tarafında ise “güneş enerjisinin küresel enerji arzının yüzde birinden daha azını oluşturduğu” söylenmektedir. Bu anlatımlar dikkate alındığında cümleyi bir anlam bütünlüğü oluşturacak şekilde en iyi tamamlayan ifadenin “‑mesi /
ması düşünüldüğünde, göz önüne alındığında” çevirileriyle B seçeneğindeki “given that” bağlacı olduğu görülür. Bu bağlamda B seçeneğindeki “given that” bağlacı kullanılarak soru kökünde “Güneş enerjisinin küresel enerji arzının yüzde birinden daha azını oluşturduğu göz önüne alındığında / düşünüldüğünde onun (güneş enerjisinin) uygulanabilirliği konusunda şüpheci olmak kolaydır.” tarzı bir anlam oluşturulabilir. Bu bilgiler ışığında doğru yanıt B seçeneğidir.
A	Bu soruda genel olarak “adverbial clause” bilgisi, daha özelde de “paralel yapılar” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Bir sorunun seçeneklerinde “not only … but also …”, “both … and …”, “either … or …”, “neither … nor …” paralel yapılarından biri veya birkaçı bulunuyorsa, öncelikle soru kökündeki boşlukların devamında bu yapıların gelmesini gerektirecek bir paralellik var olup olmadığı kontrol edilir. Bu bağlamda
A seçeneğindeki “yalnızca x değil aynı zamanda y” anlamına gelen “not solely / but” bir paralel yapı olduğu için soru kökündeki boşlukların bir paralel yapıya ihtiyaç duyup duymadığı analiz edilir. Soru kökünde hem ilk boşluğun sağ tarafında, hem de ikinci boşluğun sağ tarafında edat (on / on) bulunduğu görülür. Bu tip kullanımlar paralel yapılar için bir göstergedir. Bu bakımdan A seçeneği doğru cevap için öncelikli adaydır. Soru kökü anlam bakımından analiz edildiğinde genel olarak “Yönetim hükümetten daha geniş bir kavramdır çünkü o … devlete ve kurumlarına … sosyal uygulamalarda kuralların ve düzenin oluşturulmasına da odaklanır.” şeklinde bir anlatıma sahiptir. Bu boşluklara A seçeneğindeki “not
solely / but” yapısı getirildiği zaman cümle “Yönetim hükümetten daha geniş bir kavramdır çünkü o yalnızca devlete ve kurumlarına değil aynı zamanda sosyal uygulamalarda kuralların ve düzenin oluşturulmasına da odaklanır.” şeklinde tamamlanır. Sonuç olarak paralel yapı bilgisinin test edildiği bu soruda A seçeneği doğru yanıt olmuştur. “Correlative conjunctions” diye adlandırılan paralel yapıların bir örneği olan A seçeneğindeki “not solely … but …” ifadesinin aşağıda listelenen farklı şekillerde de görülebileceğini unutmamak gerekir.
not only …………......	but
not simply	but also
not solely	but	as well / too
not just not merely
E	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “kelime” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökünde genel olarak “İngilizcede heceleme (konusu) karmaşıklığıyla ve öğrenmesinin zor olmasıyla ünlenmiştir ve haklı olarak herhangi bir diğer alfabetik yazıma kıyasla çok daha az öngörülebilir ve çok daha az düzenli (bir heceleme tarzı) olarak ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde tamamlanması gereken bir ifade mevcuttur. Seçeneklerdeki kelimeler fiildir ve bu kelimeler,
impress(ed)  : etkilemek
neglect(ed)	: ihmal etmek, göz ardı etmek
prevail(ed)	: üstün gelmek, galip gelmek, baskın olmak
initiate(d)	: başlamak, başlatmak
describe(d)  : betimlemek, tanımlamak, tasvir etmek
anlamına gelmektedir. Seçenekler arasında anlam olarak cümleyi en uygun şekilde tamamlayan kelime E seçeneğindeki “betimlemek, tanımlamak, tasvir etmek” anlamı veren “describe” fiilidir. Buna göre cümleyi anlamca en uygun şekilde tamamlayan “describe” fiilinin verildiği E seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
A	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “kelime” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Soru kökünde genel olarak “Konuşma dilindeki kırktan fazla ‑‑‑‑ ses (ses birimi), yazı dilinde çeşitli harflerle ve harf kombinasyonlarıyla (yazı birimi) temsil edilir.” şeklinde tamamlanması gereken bir ifade mevcuttur. Seçeneklerdeki kelimeler sıfattır ve bu kelimeler,
distinctive	: farklı, belirgin
deficient	: eksik, noksa, yetersiz
impartial	: tarafsız
profound	: derin, esaslı
reluctant	: isteksiz
anlamına gelmektedir. Seçenekler arasında anlam olarak cümleyi en uygun şekilde tamamlayan kelime E seçeneğindeki “farklı, belirgin” anlamı veren “distinctive” sıfatıdır. Buna göre cümleyi anlamca en uygun şekilde tamamlayan “distinctive” sıfatının verildiği A seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
D	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “tense” ve “etken – edilgen (aktif – pasif)” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Cloze test içindeki “tense” sorularında önce boşluğun içinde bulunduğu cümlede yol gösterici olabilecek herhangi bir zaman ifadesi olup olmadığı kontrol edilir. Eğer böyle bir ifade yoksa, paragrafın genel akışı eğer present ise seçeneklerde “present” dizilimler, eğer past ise seçeneklerde “past” dizilimler tercih edilir. Bu bağlamda paragrafın tamamının present akışa sahip olduğuna dikkat edildiğinde past bir dizilim içeren A, B ve C seçeneklerinden uzak durulur. Geri kalan iki seçenek olan D ve E seçenekleri arasındaki ayrım, boşluğun içinde bulunduğu cümlenin geleceğe gönderme yapmak yerine genel – geçer / bilimsel / ansiklopedik bir bilgi veriyor olduğu bilgisine dayanarak yapılır. Bu durumda D seçeneğindeki “are represented” boşluğa gelecek olan doğru zaman ifadesi olur. Bu bağlamda bu soruda D seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
A	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “edat” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Boşluğa gelecek olan edat boşluğun sol tarafında bulunan ve “çekmek, emmek” gibi anlamlara gelen “absorb” fiili ile boşluğun devamının kurduğu anlamsal ilişki ile ilgili bir edattır. Boşluğun solunda “İngilizcenin kelimeleri emdiği” anlatılmaktadır. Boşluğun devamında ise “birçok diğer dil” gibi bir ifade bulunmaktadır. Bu durumda boşluğa ki A seçeneğindeki “from” edatı getirilerek “İngilizce birçok diğer dilden kelimeleri emmiştir” anlatımı oluşturulur. Dolayısıyla “absorb something from somewhere” şeklinde genellenebilecek bir anlatım oluşmuş olur. Bu bağlamda “from” edatının bulunduğu A seçeneği bu soruda doğru yanıttır.
B	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “gerund ‑ infinitive” ve “etken – edilgen (aktif – pasif)” bilgisi test edilmektedir. Boşluğun bir gerund mı yoksa infinitive yapıyla mı tamamlanacağını bulmak için boşluğun sol tarafına doğru açılmak gerekir. Soru kökünde boşluğun solunda bulunan “without” ifadesinin bir “edat (preposition)” olduğu görülür. Bu noktada edatlardan sonra gelecek ve edatın nesnesini oluşturacak
olan fiillerin “Ving” çekimlenmesi gerektiği bilgisi hatırlanmalıdır. Dolayısıyla öncelik A ve B seçeneklerine verilir. A seçeneği edilgen – pasif bir Ving yapıyla çekimlenmişken B seçeneği etken – aktif bir Ving çekimlemeye sahip bir ifade içermektedir. Bir boşluğun etken ya da edilgen olduğu boşluğa gelecek olan
fiilin nesnesinin yerinden anlaşılabilir. Eğer nesne boşluğun devamında ise boşluk aktif, öncesinde ise boşluk pasiftir. Boşluğa gelecek olan “adopt” fiili “benimsemek” anlamına gelir. Bu fiile sorulan “neyi benimsemek” sorusunun cevabı olan ve “onları” anlamına gelen “them” zamiri boşluğun devamındadır, yani fiilin nesnesi, etken – aktif yapılarda olması gereken yerdedir. Bu durumda boşluk etken – aktif bir boşluk olmalıdır. Bu bilgiler ışığında etken – aktif bir gerund yapı olan “adopting” ifadesinin bulunduğu B seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
C	Cloze Test içerisindeki bu soruda “adverbial clause” bilgisi test edilmektedir. A seçeneğindeki “if” bağlacı şart cümlesi oluşturur ve “eğer, ‑se / sa” çevirilerine sahiptir. B seçeneğindeki “what” ifadesi ise bir isim cümleciği (noun clause) oluşturarak bir cümlenin öznesi ya da nesnesi olabilir. Ama soru kökünde boşluğun verildiği kısımda bir özneye ya da nesneye ihtiyaç yoktur; bunun yerine iki cümleyi birbirine bağlayacak bir bağlaç gereksinimi vardır. Bu bağlamda B seçeneği doğru yanıt olamaz. C seçeneğindeki “while” bağlacının görevleri üç başlıkta toplanabilir. Birincisi devamına genellikle “Past
ise “ne de onların (insanların) şempanzeleri eğlence sektöründe kullanmak için izine ihtiyaları vardır” şeklinde bir anlam bulunmaktadır. Bu cümle soru kökü ile anlamlı bir bütün oluşturmaktadır ama bunu daha iyi görebilmek için “nor” ile bağlanan cümlelerin çevirilerini doğru yapmak gerekir. Bu bağlamda D seçeneği ile soru kökü tamamlandığında nihai çevirinin “Birleşik Devletlerdeki mevcut mevzuatlar şahsi olarak
şempanze sahibi olan insanların ne onları (bu şempanzeleri) bulundurmak için bir izne sahip olmalarını gerektirir ne de onların (insanların) şempanzeleri eğlence sektöründe kullanmak için bir izne ihtiyaçları vardır” şeklinde olması gerekir. Bu bilgiler ışığında soru köküyle hem zamir / referans kelimesi bağlantısı kuran hem de anlamca en iyi şekilde tamamlayan D seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
C	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda, “En büyük ve en pahalı filmler neredeyse hep İngilizce çekiliyor
‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Seçeneklerde doğru cevap için ipucu olarak göze çarpan ilk ifade A seçeneğinde bulunan ve “bu dil grupları” şeklinde çevrilebilecek olan “these language groups” ifadesidir. Fakat bu çoğul ifadenin karşılık gelebileceği birden çok dil grubundan bahsedilmediği ve soru kökünde sadece bir dil belirtildiği için A seçeneği doğru yanıt olamaz. Kalan seçenekler arasında
herhangi bir seçeneğe öncelik vermeyi sağlayacak ipucu bir ifade bulunmadığı için seçeneklerde verilen bağlaçların sahip olduğu anlamlardan ve genel kullanım özelliklerinden yola çıkarak elemeler yapılmalı ve soru kökü ile anlamlı bir bütün oluşturmaya çalışılmalıdır. Bu bağlamda B seçeneğinde “bu yüzden yüksek bütçeli İspanyolca ya da Hindu dilinde filmler çekmek ekonomik olarak mantıklı bir fikir olur” şeklinde bir çeviri verildiği görülür. “So” bağlacı ile başlaması bu seçeneğin soru kökündeki ifadenin bir sonucunu vermesi gerektiği anlamına gelir ama çeviriden de görüldüğü üzere bu anlam bütünlüğü oluşmamıştır. C seçeneği “because” bağlacı ile başladığı için soru kökündeki yargının nedenini anlatmalıdır. Bu seçeneğin “çünkü film endüstrisi İngilizcenin baskın olduğu Kuzey Amerika’da kurulmuştur ve gelişmiştir” şeklinde verdiği çeviriden soru köküyle bir neden‑sonuç ilişkisi oluşturabildiği görülür. D seçeneği de
birçok görevinin yanı sıra neden-sonuç da anlatabilen “as” bağlacı ile başlamıştır ama “çünkü Çin’in film bütçesi giderek yükseliyor ve Hollywood seviyelerine yaklaşıyor” anlatımı soru köküyle anlamlı bir bütün oluşturamamıştır. E seçeneği “even if” bağlacı ile başlayıp soru köküyle bir zıtlık ilişkisi kurmak zorundadır ama bu seçenekteki “uluslararası piyasa için üretilen yüksek bütçeli filmlerin çoğunda baskın dil İngilizce olmasına rağmen” çevirisi soru köküyle bir zıtlık ilişkisi kuramamaktadır. Bu bilgiler ışığında sadece C seçeneğindeki anlatım ile soru kökü arasında anlamlı bir bütün oluştuğu görülür. Bu seçenek ile soru kökü birlikte düşünüldüğünde “En büyük ve en pahalı filmler neredeyse hep İngilizce çekiliyor çünkü film endüstrisi İngilizcenin baskın olduğu Kuzey Amerika’da kurulmuş ve gelişmiş
bir endüstridir” şeklinde bir anlatım oluşur ve anlamlı bir bütün oluşur. Bu bilgiler ışığında soru köküyle bir neden-sonuç ilişkisi kurarak soru kökünü en iyi şekilde tamamlayan C seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
A	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda, “Eşitsizlik her türlü probleme neden olabilse de ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Seçeneklerde doğru cevap için ipucu olabilecek ifade A seçeneğinde bulunan ve soru kökündeki “inequality” ifadesine gönderme yapma ihtimali olan “its effects” referans kelimesidir. “Onun etkileri” anlamına gelen bu zamir / referans kelimesi, öncelikli olarak A seçeneğinin anlam analiziyle değerlendirmesini gerektirir. Bu tarz ifadelerin anlam analizini yapmadan bulundukları seçenekleri doğrudan elemek büyük bir hata olabilir. Bu bağlamda A seçeneği incelendiğinde “hükümetler onun özellikle büyüme üzerine olan etkilerinden endişe etmelidir” şeklinde bir anlatım yapıldığı görülür. Bu anlatım
ile soru kökü birleştirildiğinde oluşan “Eşitsizlik her türlü probleme neden olabilse de hükümetler onun özellikle büyüme üzerine olan etkilerinden endişe etmelidir” çevirisiyle anlamlı bir bütün oluşur. Dikkatli incelendiğinde, soru kökünde “all sorts of problems” ifadesiyle anlatılan “her türlü problem” genelinden, A seçeneğinde geçen “especially” zarfıyla geçiş yapılan “büyüme konusundaki problem” özeline “while” bağlacı ile geçiş yapılmıştır. Bu tarz genelden özele geçiş yapan anlatımlarda zıtlık bağlaçları kullanılabilir. Bu bilgiler ışığında soru köküyle hem zamir / referans kelimesi bağlantısı kuran hem de anlamca en iyi şekilde tamamlayan A seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
B	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda “Bir kitap yazmak odaklanmayı, kendini ve eserini tanımayı ve onlara (kendine ve eserine) güvenmeyi gerektirir ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Bu sorunun doğru yanıtı için ilk dikkat edilmesi gereken seçenek soru kökü ile ortak özne kullanmak zorunda olan B seçeneğidir. Dikkat edilirse bu seçenekteki “and” bağlacının yanında özne yazılmadan doğrudan yükleme geçiş yapılmıştır. Bu tarz dizilimler “and, then, but, or, yet, so” bağlaçlarının yapabildiği dizilimlerdir ve bağlanan iki cümlenin öznesinin ortak olduğu durumlarda kullanılabilirler. Bu bağlamda B seçeneğinin doğru yanıt olabilmesi için soru kökündeki öznenin bu seçeneğin de öznesi olması ve anlamlı bir bütün oluşması gerekir. Ayrıca B seçeneğindeki “and” bağlacının devamındaki fiilin “‑s” takısı almış bir V1 çekimleme
olması bu seçeneğin öznesinin tekil bir ifade olması gerektiği anlamına gelir. Soru kökündeki özne olan
“writing a book” ifadesi de tekil bir öznedir. Soru kökü B seçeneği ile tamamlandığında “Bir kitap yazmak odaklanmayı, kendini ve eserini tanımayı ve onlara güvenmeyi gerekli kılar ve gidilen yolda kalma
A	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda, “Birçok Avrupa ülkesi çok misafirperver bir görüntüye sahip değil ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Seçeneklerde doğru cevap için ipucu olarak B, C ve E seçeneklerinde bulunan ve soru kökündeki “misafirperverlik” anlamına gelen “hospitality” kelimesine gönderme yapma ihtimali olan “it” zamir / referans kelimesi düşünülebilir. Bu bağlamda bu seçenekler anlam olarak analiz edilmelidir.
B seçeneği “çünkü o (misafirperverlik) 2020’ye kadar dünyanın en büyük endüstrisi olacak” çevirisiyle ne soru köküyle bağlantılı bir anlatım yapmıştır ne de soru köküyle bir neden-sonuç ilişkisi oluşturabilmiştir. Tabii aslında bu cümlede “hospitality” kelimesinin bir diğer anlamı olan “konaklama (turizm)” anlamının kullanıldığı da bağlamdan ortaya çıkmaktadır. Sonuç olarak B seçeneği doğru yanıt olamaz. C seçeneği incelendiğinde ortaya çıkan “çünkü o (misafirperverlik), bir misafirle bir ev sahibi arasında ev sahibinin misafiri iyi niyetle ağırladığı ilişki anlamına gelir” çevirisi de soru köküyle anlamlı bir neden-sonuç ilişkisi oluşturamaz. Dolayısıyla C seçeneği de doğru yanıt değildir. Zamir / referans bağlantısından dolayı öncelik verilen seçeneklerden bir diğeri olan E seçeneğinin başındaki “just as” bağlacı, bağladığı iki cümle arasında benzer – kelime ve yapı tekrarları yardımıyla bir benzetme yaparak diğer seçeneklerdeki bağlaçlara kıyasla daha spesifik bir anlatım yapar. Fakat E seçeneğindeki “nasıl ki o uzun zamandır antropoloji çalışmalarının odak noktası olmuştur” çevirisi de soru köküyle anlam olarak örtüşen bir benzetme yapmamaktadır.
Dolayısıyla bu seçenek de doğru yanıt olamaz. Bu bağlamda geriye A ve D seçenekleri kalır. D seçeneği “çünkü misafirperverlik kavramı antik Yunan kültürüne çok derinden işlemişti” şeklinde bir çeviri vermektedir ama bu çeviri de soru kökü ile anlamlı bir neden-sonuç ilişkisi oluşturamaz. Geriye sadece A seçeneği kalır. Bu seçeneğinin başındaki “when it comes to” ifadesine cümle tamamlama sorularında her zaman dikkat edilmelidir. “When it comes to” ifadesi “konu ... ‑e gelince / geldiğinde, iş ... ‑e gelince, konu ... olduğunda” tarzı anlamlar vererek ilk bakışta ilgisiz gibi görünen iki farklı anlatımı birbirine bağlayabilir. Bu yüzden cümle tamamlama sorularında “when it comes to” ile başlayan seçenekler her zaman dikkate alınmalıdır ve anlam olarak analiz edilmelidir. A seçeneği “konu memleketlerini terketmek zorunda bırakılan mülteciler olunca” çevirisini vermektedir. Bu anlatım ile soru kökü birlikte düşünüldüğünde “Birçok Avrupa ülkesi konu memleketlerini terketmek zorunda bırakılan mülteciler olunca çok misafirperver bir görüntüye sahip değil” şeklinde anlamlı bir bütün oluştuğu görülür. Bu bilgiler ışığında soru kökünü anlamlı bir şekilde tamamlayabilen A seçeneği bu soruda doğru yanıt olur.
C	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda, “‑‑‑‑ ‘zor’ dil diye bir şey olmadığını iddia edenler hala var.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Seçeneklerde doğru cevap için ipucu olarak soru kökündeki “still” ifadesi düşünülebilir. Bu ifadenin zıtlık bağlaçlarıyla beraber kullanılabildiği düşünüldüğünde öncelik verilecek olan seçeneğin zıtlık yapabilen “while” bağlacıyla başlayan C seçeneği olduğu görülür. Bu seçenekte “neredeyse herkes bazı dilleri öğrenmenin diğerlerinden bariz bir şekilde daha zor olduğu sezgisine sahip olsa da” şeklinde
bir anlatım bulunmaktadır. Bu anlatım soru kökü ile birlikte düşünüldüğünde “neredeyse herkes bazı dilleri öğrenmenin diğerlerinden bariz bir şekilde daha zor olduğu sezgisine sahip olsa da ‘zor’ dil diye bir şey olmadığını iddia edenler hala var” şeklinde bir çeviri ortaya çıkar ve soru kökü ile C seçeneği arasında bir zıtlık ilişkisi kurulmuş olur. Bu bağlamda C seçeneği doğru yanıttır. Diğer seçenekler incelendiğinde E seçeneğinde geçen ve “bu kavramlar” anlamına gelen “these concepts” ifadesinin soru kökünde gönderme yapacağı herhangi bir çoğul kavram olmadığı için bu seçenek doğru yanıt olamaz. A seçeneğinin başındaki “just as” bağlacı, bağladığı iki cümle arasında benzer – kelime ve yapı tekrarları yardımıyla bir benzetme yaparak diğer seçeneklerdeki bağlaçlara kıyasla daha spesifik bir anlatım yapar. Fakat A seçeneğindeki
“nasıl ki anadili İngilizce olan biri için Japonca en zor dillerden biri olabilir” çevirisi de soru köküyle anlam olarak örtüşen bir benzetme yapmamaktadır. Bu seçeneğin doğru yanıt olabilmesi için soru kökünde de örneğin “anadili Fransızca olan biri için de Türkçe en zor dillerden biridir” tarzı bir anlatım yapılması gerekir. Diğer bir çeldirici olan B seçeneği “Diller arasında ciddi farklılıklar olduğu için” şeklinde bir çeviri vermektedir ama bu çeviri soru köküyle bir neden-sonuç ilişkisi kuramamaktadır.
C	Soru kökünde verilen kısımda, “‑‑‑‑ telif hakkı kanunuyla ilgilenmek için bir nedeniniz vardır.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Bu cümle tamamlama sorusunu yapmak için seçeneklerin başındaki bağlaçların verdiği anlam iyi analiz edilmelidir. Ayrıca soru kökü “you” şeklinde bir hitap kullandığında seçeneklerde de bu hitap tarzını kullananlara öncelik verilmelidir. Bu bağlamda C ve D seçenekleri ilk olarak anlam analizi yapılacak olan seçeneklerdir. C seçeneği “ister profesyonel bir yazar, bir fotoğrafçı, ister bir grafik tasarımcı olun” şeklinde bir çeviriye sahiptir ve soru kökünü anlamlı bir bütün oluşturacak şekilde tamamlayabilmektedir. D seçeneğinde ise genel olarak “Internete kendi videolarınızı yüklemeden önce herhangi bir yasal tavsiyeye ihtiyacınız yoksa” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmaktadır ama bu anlatım soru
köküyle anlamlı bir bütün oluşturamaktadır. Bu bağlamda C seçeneği doğru cevap için ön plana çıkmaktadır. Diğer seçenekler analiz edildiğinde A seçeneği zıtlık bağlacı olabilen “while” bağlacı ile başlayıp “zaten var olan bir şeyin birebir kopyasının telif hakkı alınamazken” çevirisini vermektedir. Ama bu anlatım soru köküyle bir zıtlık oluşturmamaktadır. B seçeneğinin başındaki “just as” bağlacı, bağladığı iki cümle arasında benzer – kelime ve yapı tekrarları yardımıyla bir benzetme yaparak diğer seçeneklerdeki bağlaçlara kıyasla daha spesifik bir anlatım yapar. Fakat B seçeneğindeki “nasıl ki telif hakkı kanunu fikrin kendisinden ziyade fikrin ifade edilmesini koruma altına alır” çevirisi de soru köküyle anlam olarak örtüşen bir benzetme yapmamaktadır. Son olarak E seçeneğindeki “Shakespeare gibi yazmak ya
A	Soru kökündeki “It is understood from the passage that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçadan anlaşılıyor ki ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Genel bir soru kökü olarak nitelendirebileceğimiz bu soruda seçenekler “True, False” ve “Not in the text” mantığıyla tek tek analiz edilerek doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı A seçeneğindeki “Bill Gates has been completely involved with charity work since he left Microsoft” ifadesidir. Bu ifadeyle genel olarak “Bill Gates’in Microsoft’tan ayrıldığında beri tamamıyla kendini hayır işlerine verdiği” anlatılmaktadır. A seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçada geçen “In 2008, he left Microsoft
to dedicate himself full‑time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he leads with his wife, Melinda Gates. Through their organization, the couple has donated more than $28 billion to various causes.” cümlesinden varılmaktadır. Bu cümlede altı çizili kısımda “Bill Gates’in Microsoft’tan ayrıldığı ve kendini tam zamanlı olarak Bill & Melinda Gates kurumuna adadığı ve bu kurum aracılığıyla çeşitli yerlere 28 milyar dolar bağışta bulunduğu” anlatılmaktadır. Bu anlatım A seçeneğindeki anlatımla örtüşmektedir. Bu bağlamda doğru yanıt A seçeneğidir.

C	Soru kökündeki “It is understood from the passage that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçadan anlaşılıyor ki ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Genel bir soru kökü olarak nitelendirebileceğimiz bu soruda seçenekler “True, False” ve “Not in the text” mantığıyla tek tek analiz edilerek doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı
C seçeneğindeki “the ability to track animals in their habitat helps us improve our understanding of the ecosystems they belong” ifadesidir. Bu ifadeyle genel olarak “hayvanları doğal ortamlarında izleyebilme becerisinin onların ait oldukları ekosistemleri anlamamızı geliştirmede bize yardımcı
olmakta olduğu” anlatılmaktadır. C seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçada geçen “With rapid technological advancement over the past several decades, a suite of electronic tracking devices (e.g., acoustic and satellite transmitters) that can remotely monitor animals in these challenging environments are now available. Aquatic telemetry technology is rapidly accelerating our ability to observe animal behavior and distribution and, as a consequence, is fundamentally altering our understanding of the structure and function of global aquatic ecosystems.” cümlelerinden varılmaktadır. Bu cümlelerde ve özellikle de altı çizili kısımda “sualtı hayvanlarını izleme teknolojilerinin hızla gelişerek bizim bu hayvanların davranışlarını ve dağılımını gözlemlememizi mümkün kıldığı ve bunun sonucunda
da küresel sualtı ekosistemlerin yapısı ve işlevi hakkında anlayışımızın kökünden değiştiği” anlatılmaktadır. Bu anlatım C seçeneğindeki anlatımla örtüşmektedir. Bu bağlamda doğru yanıt C seçeneğidir.

Sorunun doğru yanıtı B seçeneğindeki “human interference is to blame for the substantial alterations in global aquatic environments” ifadesidir. Bu ifadeyle genel olarak “dünya çapında sualtı ortamlarındaki ciddi değişikliklerin sorumlusunun insan müdahalesi olduğu” anlatılmaktadır. B seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçanın birinci cümlesi olan “Global aquatic environments are changing profoundly as a result
of human actions…” cümlesinden varılmaktadır. Bu cümlede “dünya çapında sualtı ortamlarının
insanların eylemlerinin sonucu olarak derin bir değişim yaşadığı” anlatılmaktadır. Bu anlatım B
seçeneğindeki anlatımla örtüşmektedir. Bu bağlamda doğru yanıt B seçeneğidir.

E	Soru kökündeki “The passage suggests that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi genel olarak “Parçada öne sürülüyor ki ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Net bir ipucu olmayan genel bir soru kökü olarak nitelendirebileceğimiz bu soruda seçenekler “True, False” ve “Not in the text” mantığıyla tek tek analiz edilerek doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı E seçeneğindeki “inherent properties of the aquatic environments have long proved to be a major obstacle in understanding these ecosystems” ifadesidir. Bu ifade genel olarak “sualtı ortamlarının doğal özellikleri uzun zamandır bu ekosistemleri anlamamız önünde büyük
bir engel teşkil etmiştir.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. E seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçadaki “Until recently, the vast size, opacity, and dynamic nature of the aquatic realm impeded our efforts to understand these ecosystems” cümlesinden ulaşılabilir. Bu cümlede genel olarak “son dönemlere kadar devasa boyutu, saydam olmayışı ve sualtı ortamının dinamik doğası bu ekosistemleri anlama çabalarımızı baltalamıştı.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapmaktadır. Bu cümlede özellikle “son dönemlere kadar” ifadesiyle E seçeneğindeki “uzun zamandır” ifadesi örtüştürülebilir. Ayrıca “devasa boyutu, saydam olmayışı ve sualtı ortamının dinamik doğası” gibi özellikler E seçenğinde bahsedilen “sualtı ortamlarının doğaları gereği olan özellikleri” olarak düşünülebilir. Bu noklara dikkat ederek parçada geçen bu cümleden, E seçeneğindeki “sualtı ortamının doğal özelliklerinin onları anlamızı uzun süre engellediği” yargısına varılabilir. Buna göre doğru yanıt E seçeneğidir.
Çeldiriciler:
hayvan davranışını anlamak ucuz olmayan teknolojiler gerektiren hassas bir konudur.
uzun süredir hayvanların yaşayıp geliştiği ortamların işleyişini anlamlandıramamaktayız.
insan kaynaklı aktivitelerle sualtı ortamlarındaki değişiklikler arasında bir bağlantı kurmak zor.
akustik ve uydu vericileri son teknoloji ürünlerdir ama yine de onların güvenliği sorgulanmaktadır.
A	Soru kökündeki “It can be inferred from the passage that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçadan çıkarılabilir ki ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Bu soruda parçadan çıkarım yoluyla elde edilebilecek bir bilgi sorulmaktadır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı A seçeneğindeki “human beings benefit from what aquatic ecosystems offer” ifadesidir. Bu ifade genel olarak “insanoğlu sualtı ekosistemlerinin sunduğu şeylerden faydalanmaktadır.” anlamını vermektedir. A seçeneğindeki bu ifade parçada geçen “These patterns and processes ultimately structure aquatic ecosystems and provide the wealth of ecosystem services upon which humans depend” cümlesinden çıkılabilecek bir ifadedir. Bu cümlede altı çizili kısım genel olarak “insanların ekosistemlerin (hizmetlerinin / sunduklarının) zenginliğine bel bağladığı / bağımlı olduğu” anlamı vermektedir ve buradan öğrenilen bilgi A seçeneğindeki yargı ile örtüşmektedir. Buradaki anlatımdan “eğer insanlar sualtı ekosistemlerine bağlıysa / bağımlıysa, o zaman onların sunduğu şeyleri insanların kullandıkları” anlamı çıkmaktadır. Bu açıklama doğrultusunda doğru yanıt A seçeneğidir.
Çeldiriciler:
okyanuslardaki hayvanları incelemek karadakileri incelemekten çok daha meşakkatlidir.
yeni teknolojik cihazlardan derlenen bilgiler güvenilir olmayabilir.
devasa olmadığı sürece, organizma toplulukları dış değişikliklere tepki vermez.
hayvan davranışı ve dağılımındaki değişimler çok ani olur ki bu da onları gözlemlemeyi zorlaştırır.
C	Soru kökündeki “It is stated in the passage that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçada belirtiliyor ki ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Net ipucu içermeyen bir soru kökü olarak nitelendirebileceğimiz bu soruda seçenekler “True, False” ve “Not in the text” mantığıyla tek tek analiz edilerek doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı C seçeneğindeki “certain issues would not come to public attention without media coverage” ifadesidir. Bu ifade genel olarak “bazı konuların medya ele almasa halkın dikkatini çekmeyecek olduğunu” anlatmaktadır. C seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçada geçen “The media is also an important accountability mechanism: it raises important issues, corruption for example, that might otherwise never be publicly debated or addressed.” cümlesinden ulaşılabilir. Bu cümlede ve özellikle de altı çizili kısımda “medyanın kendisi ele almazsa asla halk arasında tartışılmayacak ya da ele alınmayacak önemli konuları gündeme getirdiği” anlatılmaktadır. Bu bilgiler C seçeneği ile örtüşmektedir. Bundan dolayı C seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
Çeldiriciler:
gazeteler, TV ve radyo nüfusu kontrol altında tutmak için yanlış bilgiler yayıyor.
yozlaşma ve şiddet gibi önemli konular medya tarafından görmezden geliniyor.
hükümetler, kusurlarının ifşa edileceğinden korktukları için medyaya sansür uyguluyorlar.
hükümetlerin bütün kamusal politikalarını yakından takip etmek medyanın sorumluluklarından biridir.
D	Soru kökündeki “As understood from the passage, ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçadan anlaşıldığı gibi ‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Genel bir soru kökü olarak nitelendirebileceğimiz bu soruda seçenekler “True, False” ve “Not in the text” mantığıyla tek tek analiz edilerek doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı
D seçeneğindeki “it is the radical ideas that draw more public attention, so they are covered more in the media.” ifadesidir. Bu ifadeyle genel olarak “daha fazla dikkat çeken fikirlerin radikal fikirler olduğu, bu nedenle de bunlara medyada daha çok yer verildiği” anlatılmaktadır. D seçeneğindeki bu ifadeye parçada geçen “The media often prefers to dwell on conflict, since conflict and drama sell
newspapers and attract an audience. This inevitably means that the more extreme points of view get airtime rather than the feelings of the majority of citizens that may have more accommodating and balanced perspectives” cümlesinden varılmaktadır. Bu cümlede altı çizili kısımda “çatışma ve heyecan verici / üzücü olayların gazeteleri sattırdığı ve izleyici çektiği” anlatılmıştır ve ardından da “bunun da vatandaşların çoğunluğunun sahip olduğu kucaklayıcı ve dengeli bakış açılarından ziyade daha radikal görüşlerin yayınlanmakta olduğu anlamına geldiği” anlatılmaktadır. Bu anlatım D seçeneğindeki anlatımla örtüşmektedir. Bu cümlede “airtime” ifadesinin “yayın, yayında olunan zaman” anlamına geldiğini bilmek önem arz edebilir. Sonuç olarak doğru yanıt D seçeneğidir.
Çeldiriciler:
insanlar arasında genel eğilim medyanın sunduğu şeyi tereddütsüz kabul etmektir.
medya son yıllarda toplumun farklı kesimleri tarafından kendisine biçilen rolü yerine getirmede başarısız oldu.
insanlar ve yerler hakkında yanlış haberler yaymak özellikle gazetecilikte yaygın bir uygulamadır.
E) gazeteler doğruya sadık kalarak tirajlarını yüksek tutmaya çalışır.
E	Soru kökündeki “It can be inferred from the passage that ‑‑‑‑.” ifadesi “Parçadan çıkarılabilir ki
‑‑‑‑.” şeklinde çevrilebilir. Bu soruda parçadan çıkarım yoluyla elde edilebilecek bir bilgi sorulmaktadır. Sorunun doğru yanıtı E seçeneğindeki “the way a piece of information is presented by the media can substantially influence the public reaction” ifadesidir. Bu ifade genel olarak “bir bilginin medya tarafından sunulma şekli halkın tepkisini ciddi anlamda etkileyebilir” anlamını vermektedir. E
seçeneğindeki bu ifade parçada geçen “But the media can also, in some cases, become an instrument for the spread of false and inflammatory messages and values that do not promote respect or well‑tempered dialogue and discussion. Negative messages can divide communities and can
help reinforce the stereotypes that nurture violence” kısmından çıkılabilecek bir ifadedir. Bu kısımda, özellikle de altı çizili bölümde genel olarak “medyanın saygıyı ya da ölçülü diyalog ve tartışmaları teşvik etmeyen kızıştırıcı mesajları ve değerleri yaymak için bir araç olabileceği ve bu olumsuz mesajların toplumları bölebileceği ve şiddeti körükleyen basmakalıp fikirlerin güçlenmesini teşvik edebileceği” anlamı verilmektedir ve buradan öğrenilen bilgi E seçeneğindeki yargı ile örtüşmektedir. Bu açıklama doğrultusunda doğru yanıt E seçeneğidir.
E	Diyalogda Saul ve Mike arasındaki konuşmada, Saul ikinci konuşmasında “Öyle bir şey yapma lüksün yok. Her şey özenli ve düzgün olmak zorunda.” şeklinde bir cümle kurmuştur. Buradan anlaşılan boşluğa gelecek olan cümlede “bir şeyin Saul’un konuşmasında istediği şekilde olmaması ihtimalinden” bahsedilmesi gerekir. Seçenekler analiz edildiğinde bu tarz bir anlatımı “Biraz endişeliyim. Ya bir şeyi unutursam?” çevirisiyle E seçeneğinin yaptığı görülmektedir. Bu bağlamda “öyle bir şey yapma lüksün yok” denilen şey “bir şeyi unutma ihtimali” olarak düşünülmelidir. Bu bilgiler ışığında doğru yanıt E seçeneğidir. Diğer seçenekler incelendiğinde A seçeneğinde “Hangi talimatlardan bahsediyorsun?
Bana hiçbir şey verilmedi.” denirken B seçeneğinde “Yapacağım fakat bu görev göründüğünden daha zor. Zamanında bitirebileceğimizden emin misin?” şeklinde bir soru sorulmuştur. C seçeneği “Aslında, talimatlar açık bir şekilde belirtilmemiş ama başka seçeneğim yok, değil mi?” şeklinde bir anlatım yaparken D seçeneği “Bunu zaten yapıyorum. İçin rahat olsun, her şey güzel olacak” şeklinde çevrilebilir.
Doğru seçenek ile tamamlanan diyalog:
Saul:
Bu görevi bitirmende sana verilen talimatlara uyman büyük önem arz ediyor. Mike:
Biraz endişeliyim. Ya bir şeyi unutursam?
Saul:
Öyle bir şey yapma lüksün yok. Her şey özenli ve düzgün olmak zorunda. Mike:
Bunu sağlamak adına elimden geleni yapacağım.
C	Diyalogda Gustavo ve Ted arasındaki konuşmada Gustavo önce Ted’in “son altı aydır Çin’de yaşadığını” teyit ettirmiştir ve ardından ikinci konuşmasında “orada çatal bıçakla mı yemek yediğini yoksa çubukları mı tercih ettiğini” sormuştur. Buradan anlaşılan boşluğa gelecek olan cümlede bu sorunun cevabı olması gerektiği düşünülmelidir. Ayrıca verilecek cevaba Gustavo’nun üçüncü konuşmasında “anlaşılan sen oraya alışmışsın” şeklinde bir tepki vermesi boşluğa gelecek cümlede “çatal bıçak yerine çubukların tercih edildiğinin” söylenmesi gerektiği anlamına gelir. Bu anlatımı yapan tek seçenek C seçeneğidir. Bu seçenekte verilen “Aslında ne yediğime bağlı ama çoğunlukla ikinci dediğinle (çubuklarla) yemeyi seviyorum” anlatımı diyaloğu doğru bir şekilde tamamlamaktadır. Bu cümlede “daha önceden bahsedilen iki kavrama” gönderme yapabilen ve “ilki … ikincisi” şeklinde çevrilen “the former … the latter” yapısından “the latter” kelimesinin kullanımı doğru cevap için önemli rol oynamaktadır. Bu bilgiler ışığında doğru yanıt C seçeneğidir.
Diğer seçenekler incelendiğinde A seçeneğinde “Hiçbir şey çatal bıçağın yerini tutamaz. Diyeceğim tek şey bu.” denirken B seçeneğinde “Eğer bunu bana soruyorsan, o zaman çubukları kullandığımı düşünüyorsun ki kullanmıyorum” şeklinde bir anlatım vardır. D seçeneği “Biliyorsun çubukları kullandığım zaman yiyecekler o kadar lezzetli olmuyor.” şeklinde bir anlatım yaparken E seçeneği “Ne kadar uğraşırsan uğraş bazı alışkanlıkları kırmak çok zor.” şeklinde çevrilebilir.
Doğru seçenek ile tamamlanan diyalog:
Gustavo:
Sen şimdi bir süredir Çin’de yaşıyorsun, doğru mu? Ted:
Doğru. Şu an itibarıyla altı ay oldu. Gustavo:
Sandığımdan da fazla olmuş. Söylesene, yemek yerken çatal bıçak mı yoksa çubukları mı tercih ediyorsun?
Ted:
Aslında ne yediğime bağlı ama çoğunlukla ikinci dediğinle (çubuklarla) yemeyi seviyorum.
Gustavo:
Anlaşılan sen oraya alışmışsın.

B	Soru kökündeki cümlenin parçalar halinde değerlendirilip doğru yanıt olan B seçeneğindeki cümle ile karşılaştırılmasını aşağıdaki iki analiz tablosunda detaylı olarak görebilirsiniz.
B	Bu paragraf tamamlama sorusunda doğru yanıta ulaşmak için boşluktan sonraki cümlede geçen “however” ifadesi en önemli rolü oynar. Bu ifade içinde bulunduğu cümle ile boşluk arasında bir zıtlık bağlantısı kurmaya çalıştığı gibi devamına “also” zarfını alarak bir ekleme anlamı da verebilir. Bu bağlamda boşluğun devamı anlam bakımından analiz edilmelidir ve çıkan anlamlar ile hangi seçeneğin zıtlık / ekleme bağlantısı oluşturduğu bulunarak doğru yanıta ulaşılmalıdır. Boşluğun devamında “Ama vatandaşların kendilerinin de karar verme sürecinde aktif bir rol oynamasına izin veren yöntemler vardır.” şeklinde bir anlatım içermektedir. Dolayısıyla doğru yanıtın “vatandaşların kendilerinin aktif
bir şekilde rol almadığı bir karar verme sürecinden” bahsetmesi gerekmektedir. Seçenekler arasında herhangi bir zamir / referans kelimesi ya da cümle zarfı bulundurmadığı için herhangi birine öncelik verilemez. Dolayısıyla bütün seçenekler anlam bakımından analiz edilmelidir. Bu yapıldığında boşluğun sonrası ile yukarıda anlatılan ekleme bağlantısını kuran seçeneğin “Temsili demokraside tipik olarak kurumlar, vatandaşların adına politik kararlar alan seçilmiş politikacılara bağlıdır” çevirisiyle B seçeneği olduğu görülür. Bu anlatımda özellikle “vatandaşların adına siyasetçilerin karar aldığı” bilgisi boşluğun devamındaki “vatandaşların kendilerinin de karar verme sürecinde aktif rol alabileceği yöntemler olduğu” cümlesiyle anlam olarak örtüşmektedir ve bu iki cümle arasında “ama (ayrıca)” şeklinde bir geçiş yapılabilir. Bu bağlamda boşluğun devamını cümle zarfı bağlantısını doğru kurarak anlamlı bir bütün oluşturabilecek şekilde tamamlayan B seçeneği bu soruda doğru yanıttır. Diğer seçenekler incelendiğinde A seçeneği “Daha detaylı bir demokratik teori fayda kadar zarar da getirebilir” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır ama bu anlatım boşluğun devamı ile yukarıda anlatılan bağlantılar bazında örtüşmez. Aynı durum “Siyasi liderler her seçimden önce tipik olarak değişim ve gelişim sözü verir” şeklinde çevrilen C seçeneği, “Bütün baskın ulusal karakterler ve gelenekler devamlı olarak değişime açıktır” çevirisini veren D ve “Her devlet bakanlığının bakanlığa ait gelenekleri vardır ve bunlar genellikle ritüeller ve rutin olaylar şeklinde vücut bulur” anlatımını yapan E seçeneği için de geçerlidir.
D	Bu paragraf tamamlama sorusunda doğru yanıta ulaşmada boşluktan sonraki cümlede geçen “this rich cultural heritage” referans ifadesi en önemli rolü oynar. Bu ifade doğrultusunda boşluğa gelecek seçenekte “bu zengin kültür mirası” anlamına gelen “this rich cultural heritage” ifadesine karşılık gelebilecek bir mirastan bahsedilmelidir. Seçenekler bu bağlamda analiz edildiğinde sadece D seçeneğinde “Etiyopya’da binlerce kilise vardır ve neredeyse her birinde antik ve bazen de bilinmeyen dini metinler içeren parşömen el yazıtları bulunmaktadır” anlatımıyla “zengin bir kütürel mirastan” bahsedildiği görülür. Boşluğun öncesinde bulunan “Bu ülkenin hazinelerinden biri de ayrılmaz bir şekilde ülkedeki Hristiyan geleneğine bağlı olan el yazıtı kültürüdür” ifadesi de D seçeneğindeki anlatımla, özellikle de “kilise, el yazıtları ve kültür” anlatımıyla örtüşmektedir. Diğer seçeneklerin hiçbirinde yukarıda anlatılan bağlantıların bulunmadığı da düşünüldüğünde bu paragraf tamamlama sorusunda D seçeneği doğru yanıt olur. Diğer seçenekler incelendiğinde A seçeneği genel olarak “bazen saklama yönteminde yapılacak ciltleri
yerden kaldırmak gibi basit, temel bir değişikliğin etkili bir şekilde el yazıtı güvenliğini artırdığından” bahsederek genel olarak “el yazıtlarının muhafaza edilmesinin nasıl geliştirilebileceğini” anlatmaktadır. B seçeneğinde geçen ve “böyle alanlar” şeklinde çevrilebilen “such areas” ifadesinin boşluğun öncesinde gönderme yapabileceği çoğul bir alan isminden bahsedilmediği için bu seçenekten uzak durulur. C seçeneği “Etiyopya’ya gelince” anlamına gelen “As for Ethiopia” ifadesiyle başlamıştır ve bu ifade boşluğun öncesinde başka bir ülkeden bahsedildiği çağrışımını yapar. Fakat boşluğun öncesinde de “Etiyopya’dan” bahsedildiği için C seçeneği de doğru yanıt değildir. E seçeneği “Etiyopya Ortodoks Kilisesi’nde haçın neyi sembolize ettiğini” anlatmaktadır ama bu anlatım ne boşluğun öncesinden ne de sonrasında yapılan anlatımlarla örtüşmektedir.
A	Paragrafın I. cümlesinde “Standart gen kopyalama modeli bilinen binlerce gen ailesinin çoğunu açıklar fakat bu model kazı kısıtlamalara sahiptir.” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Bu bağlamda paragrafın konusunun “standart gen kopyalama yönteminin kısıtlamaları” olması ve paragrafta “bu kısıtlamaların neler olduğunun” anlatılması gerekir. Fakat paragrafın II. cümlesinde yapılan “Genler de insanlar gibi ailelere sahiptir ve zamanda geriye doğru giderek kurucu bir üyeye dayanan soyları vardır” anlatımıyla başka bir konu olan “gen ailelerinin kökeninden ve genlerin nasıl oluştuğundan” bahsedilmektedir. Unutulmamalıdır ki her paragrafta paragrafın konusunu (topic) ve bu konuya olan bakış açısını (controlling idea) veren bir tane giriş cümlesi (topic sentence) olur. Dolayısıyla paragrafın ilk iki cümlesi olan I. ve II. cümlelerinin topic ve controlling idea anlatımlarının farklı olması bunlardan birinin anlam bütünlüğünü bozan cümle olduğu anlamına gelir. Bu tip durumlarda III. cümle büyük önem kazanır çünkü III. cümle I. ve II. cümlelerde yapılan anlatımlardan hangisini destekliyorsa diğeri anlam bütünlüğünü bozan cümle konumuna düşer. Bu bağlamda III. cümlenin “bu ata” anlamına gelen “that ancestor” referans kelimesi
ile başladığı ve bu ifadenin II. cümlede “kurucu bir üye” diye bahsedilen ve “gen ailelerinin soylarının dayandığı ilk gene” gönderme yaptığı anlaşılır. Bu bağlamda III. cümle, II. cümledeki anlatımı devam ettiren bir “supporting sentence (destekleyici cümle)” olmuştur. Paragraftaki diğer “supporting sentences” olan IV. ve V. cümleler de II. cümledeki konuyu ve bakış açısını desteklediği için “standart gen kopyalama yönteminin kısıtlamaları” konusunu anlatması gereken I. cümle anlam bütünlüğünü bozmaktadır. Başka bir deyişle I. cümlede konu “standart gen kopyalama yönteminin kısıtlamaları” olmasına rağmen geri kalan cümlelerde konu “gen ailelerinin kökenleri ve genlerin nasıl oluştuğu” olmuştur. Dolayısıyla I. cümle anlatımın akışını bozan cümledir ve bu cümleyi temsil eden A seçeneği doğru yanıttır.
D	Paragrafın I. cümlesinde “William Shakespeare’in tarihteki en etkileyici edebi figürlerden olduğu ve eşi benzeri olmayan bir tiyatro ve şiir ustası olduğu” anlatılmıştır. II. cümle “he” zamiri ile başlayarak
cümlenin öznesi olan “Shakespeare” öznesine gönderme yapar ve “O (Shakespeare) 37 oyun ve beş şiir koleksiyonu yazdı ve toplamda 17,677 eşsiz kelime kullandı” şeklinde bir çeviri verir. Bu anlatımla birlikte I. ve II. cümlenin anlatım olarak birbirini tuttuğu görülür. III. cümle yine “he” zamirini kullanarak Shakespeare’e gönderme yapmaya çalışmaktadır ve bu cümlenin “(onun) kullandığı kelimelerin yaklaşık yüzde onu tamamıyla kendi türettiği kelimelerdir” şeklinde yaptığı anlatım, II. cümledeki “17,677
eşsiz kelimenin yüzde 10’una” gönderme yapmaktadır. Bu bağlamda I., II. ve III. cümleler paragrafta bir anlam akışı sağlamaktadır. IV. cümle “dilimizin ne kadar hızlı değiştiği ve Shakespeare’in eserlerinin ne kadar uzun zaman önce yazıldığı düşünüldüğünde onun oyunlarını ve sonelerinin anlaşılmaz görünmesi şaşırtıcı değildir” şeklinde bir anlatım yapmıştır. Fakat bu anlatımda konu “Shakespeare’in eserlerinin neden anlaşılmadığı” şeklinde değişmiş ve “bunun için birkaç gerekçe” söylenmiştir.
V. cümlede tekrardan “Shakespeare’in eserlerinde kullandığı eşsiz ve kendi bulduğu kelimelere” dönülerek “Bugün kullandığınız kelimelerin tamamı içinden en az bir tanesi muhtemelen Shakespeare tarafından türetilmiştir, tabii İngilizce konuştuğunuzu varsayarsak” şeklinde bir anlatım yapılmıştır. Bu son cümlede “günümüzdeki İngilizcede de Shakespeare’in türettiği ve kullandığı kelimelerin hala var olduğu” anlatılarak III. cümleyle bağlantı kuran bir anlatım akışı oluşturulmuş olur. Bu bağlamda I., II., III., ve V. cümleler paragrafın anlam akışını sağlarken IV. cümle diğer cümlelerde “Shakespeare konusunun incelenmekte olan yönünü, yani konuya olan bakış açısını (controllling idea)” değiştirerek anlatımın akışını bozan cümle olmuştur. Bu cümleyi temsil eden D seçeneği bu soruda doğru yanıttır.
